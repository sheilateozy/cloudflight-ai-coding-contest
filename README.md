## About
These are my solutions for the 2023 Cloudflight Coding Contest (AI Category), one of the largest coding competitions in Europe. 

The prediction task posed from Level 5 onwards is a regression task using tabular data. I created a stacked ensemble from 40 base models of 3 algorithm types â€” Deep Neural Network, XGBoost, and LightGBM, and I placed top 10% on the competition leaderboard within a training time of 1 hour.

## Medium Article
I also wrote a Medium article, [Stacked Ensembles for Advanced Predictive Modeling With H2O.ai and Optuna](https://towardsdatascience.com/stacked-ensembles-for-advanced-predictive-modeling-with-h2o-ai-and-optuna-8c339f8fb602), where I provided a walk-through of my full code for training this stacked ensemble. This article was published in Towards Data Science, Medium's #1 Data Science publication.
